# IMDB-SentimentAnalysis-NN
We will be using keras to perform sentiment analysis on keras.<br>
IMDB dataset is being used <br>
We will use Neural Networks to do Sentiment Analysis . I recommend it to train it on GPU/TPu.<br>
I myself have used google colab.<br>
## Requirements
- Keras (v2.3.0+)
- Tensorflow [v2 prefered, v1 might also work]
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
## Results
- 88.2% accuracy on test data
- 96% accuracy on train data
